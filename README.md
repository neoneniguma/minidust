# Minidust

A lightweight, Minitest-first coverage reporter that focuses only on your code ‚Äî not your gems. Minidust filters out noise, highlights which files are being tested, and gives you a clean, color-coded breakdown of test coverage right in your terminal.      

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'minidust'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minidust

## Usage

There are two ways to run minidust:

### When invoking an individual test:

```bash
Minidust CLI starting with args: ["test/hello_world_test.rb"]
Running test/hello_world_test.rb with Minidust enabled...
Run options: --seed 6158

# Running:  

.

Finished in 0.000497s, 2012.0731 runs/s, 2012.0731 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

== Minidust Coverage Report ==
/Users/mariumali/minidust/lib/hello_world.rb: 100.0% (2/2)
```

### Apart of each test run

Add minidust to your test helper
In your test/test_helper.rb (or wherever your Minitest setup lives), require and enable Minidust:

```ruby
require "minidust"
Minidust.enable!
```

This automatically starts coverage tracking and prints a colorized coverage report after your tests run.

Run your tests using the minidust cli command
For example:

```bash
minidust test/hello_world_test.rb
```

You‚Äôll see a terminal output like:

```bash
== Minidust Coverage Report ==
lib/hello_world.rb: 100.0% (6/6)
```

or on multiple files:

```bash
minidust test/hello_world_test.rb
```

üîç What it does
Tracks which lines in your app were run during each test file

Displays only the relevant files (no gem/library noise)

Outputs a colorized summary at the end of the test


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
