# Minidust

Minidust is a lightweight, Minitest-first coverage reporter that helps you focus on what's being tested ‚Äî one file at a time. Unlike traditional coverage tools, Minidust doesn't give you an overall percentage. Instead, it reports only the coverage for the file being tested, filtering out gems and unrelated files. Perfect for keeping your tests focused and your coverage clean.


## üîç What it does

üìÑ Tracks which lines in a single source file are executed by a single test file

üéØ Focuses on 1-to-1 coverage ‚Äî no overall summary, no multi-file aggregation

üö´ Ignores gem/library files ‚Äî only shows coverage for your app's files

üåà Outputs a clean, colorized coverage report at the end of each test run

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'minidust'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minidust

## Usage

There are two ways to run minidust:

### When invoking an individual test:

```bash
Minidust CLI starting with args: ["test/hello_world_test.rb"]
Running test/hello_world_test.rb with Minidust enabled...
Run options: --seed 6158

# Running:  

.

Finished in 0.000497s, 2012.0731 runs/s, 2012.0731 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

== Minidust Coverage Report ==
/Users/mariumali/minidust/lib/hello_world.rb: 100.0% (2/2)
```

### Apart of each test run

Add minidust to your test helper
In your test/test_helper.rb (or wherever your Minitest setup lives), require and enable Minidust:

```ruby
require "minidust"
Minidust.enable!
```

This automatically starts coverage tracking and prints a colorized coverage report after your tests run.

Run your tests using the minidust cli command
For example:

```bash
minidust test/hello_world_test.rb
```

You'll see a terminal output like:

```bash
== Minidust Coverage Report ==
lib/hello_world.rb: 100.0% (6/6)
```

or on multiple files:

```bash
minidust test/hello_world_test.rb
```

## Configuration

Minidust can be configured using a `.minidust.yml` file in your project's root directory. This allows you to specify which paths to include in or exclude from the coverage analysis.

Create a `.minidust.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
# Paths to include in coverage analysis
include_paths:
  - lib/          # Include all files under lib/
  - src/          # You can add additional source directories
  - app/models/   # You can be more specific with paths

# Paths to exclude from coverage analysis
exclude_paths:
  - test/         # Exclude test files
  - spec/         # Exclude RSpec files
  - features/     # Exclude Cucumber files
  - examples/     # Exclude example files
```

If no configuration file is present, Minidust will use these defaults:
- Include: `lib/`
- Exclude: `test/`, `spec/`, `features/`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
